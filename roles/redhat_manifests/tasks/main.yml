#  There are really two aspects to manifests.
#  1. Creating, modifying, and deleting a manifest on the portal. And fetching the manifest..
#  2. Uploading, refreshing and replacing manifests on the Satellite

# This module only deals with item 1.
# The RHISAM doesn't provide a manifest.
# All manifests are user manifests.
